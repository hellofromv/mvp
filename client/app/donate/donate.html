          <p class="indent fade-in">"Audrey and Eldad Hagar have been fostering hundreds of animals in their home for the past eight years.  They created Hope for Paws to help animals in this country who suffer and die every year because of negligence and abuse.  They also created a huge network of rescuers from all over the world on their Facebook pages.
Our fostered animals are a part of our family and are treated as such.  Too often, people undervalue their furry family members and abandon them in their backyards, on the streets or at the shelters.  These animals die from starvation, abuse, and euthanization because of the overcrowding at the shelters.
Pets are not items that can be thrown away or exchanged for younger models. Animals are sentient beings who feel pain, love, joy, mourning, and loss.  These valuable creatures help us whether it is assisting the blind or finding people under the rubble from an earthquake.  They help us in times of war and during human catastrophes.
We want to help both humans and animals alike live harmonious and fulfilling lives together."</p>

          <p class="indent fade-in">"Animal Humane Society helps thousands of dogs, cats, and critters in need find loving homes each year — and no animal is ever turned away.

AHS takes in every animal surrendered to us regardless of its health, age, breed or behavior. This commitment to open admission guarantees shelter and care to thousands of animals that would otherwise have no safe refuge. We also take in animals from municipal shelters and other organizations that don’t have the resources to care for them.

Although many animals can be placed in our adoption programs as soon as they are vaccinated and sterilized, others require specialized care to overcome health and behavior issues. AHS provides extensive medical treatment, surgery, behavior modification, and foster care to those with special challenges, ensuring that even the most difficult-to-place animals have a chance at adoption.

As a result of these extraordinary efforts, more than 91 percent of the animals that came through our doors in FY15 were adopted or placed in the community."</p>
